#Hello World

###Your first web server.

Write a flask app in the `hello.py` file.

- This app should simply return 'Hello World' regardless of the URL.
- When you open [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) you should see "Hello World".

Test your app by running `hello_tests.py`. Both tests should pass.
